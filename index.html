        <p class="story-text">
            The storm was fierce as Alex arrived at the old mansion, its windows dark and empty. The air felt thick and
            strange, like something was watching him. His uncle had sent him a strange letter before he died, asking
            Alex to come here to find a family secret.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            As he pushed open the heavy door, a cold gust hit him, and his flashlight flickered. Shadows seemed to shift
            on the walls, as if they were alive. The house was silent, except for a faint creaking sound upstairs. Alex
            climbed the staircase, each step moaning under his weight.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            At the end of a dark hallway was his uncle’s study. Inside, dust covered everything except a small, old
            chest on the desk. Curiosity got the best of him, and he opened it. Inside were a bundle of letters, a
            broken compass, and an old photograph of his uncle, staring out with eyes that felt strangely alive.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            Just then, he heard slow footsteps coming down the hall, dragging and heavy. His heart raced as a low,
            whispering voice said his name. He turned, but no one was there. The air felt colder, like something was
            right behind him.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            Suddenly, the letters in the chest scattered across the floor, as if blown by a breeze, though the windows
            were closed. Among them, he found a diary with a single red page. The message read: "To whoever finds this,
            beware. This house keeps its guests forever."
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            The footsteps grew louder, coming closer. He dropped the diary and ran for the door, feeling shadows reach
            out for him. As he neared the exit, a cold hand brushed his shoulder, and a voice whispered, "You belong
            here now."
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            With all his strength, Alex burst out of the door into the rain, running as fast as he could down the
            overgrown path. The mansion stood behind him, its windows glowing faintly, as if watching him leave. But
            even as he escaped, he could still hear it—a faint whisper, promising it would find him again.
